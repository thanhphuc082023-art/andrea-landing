# Performance Optimization Implementation Summary

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) Optimizations

#### Header Image Priority

- ✅ Added `priority={true}` to the main header background image
- ✅ Added `fetchPriority="high"` for immediate discovery
- ✅ Increased image quality to 90% for better visual experience
- ✅ Added image preload link in PerformanceOptimizations component

#### Featured Projects Images

- ✅ Added `priority` flag to the first large project image (Mitsubishi)
- ✅ Added `loading="eager"` to second featured image
- ✅ Increased quality to 85% for above-the-fold images

### 2. Image Delivery Optimizations

#### All Project Images

- ✅ Added `loading="lazy"` to below-the-fold images
- ✅ Increased quality from 75% to 80-85% for better visual experience
- ✅ Maintained Next.js Image component for automatic format optimization

### 3. Legacy JavaScript Reduction

#### Next.js Configuration

- ✅ Added webpack configuration targeting ES2020
- ✅ Added `legacyBrowsers: false` to experimental config
- ✅ Added `browsersListForSwc: true` for modern JavaScript compilation
- ✅ Added browserslist targeting modern browsers with ES6 module support

#### Babel Configuration

- ✅ Created .babelrc targeting ES modules
- ✅ Disabled modules transformation for better tree shaking
- ✅ Added optimize-clsx plugin for smaller bundle size

### 4. Forced Reflow Prevention

#### Performance Hooks

- ✅ Created `useOptimizedLayout()` hook for batched DOM operations
- ✅ Created `useScrollOptimization()` hook with requestAnimationFrame
- ✅ Added scroll event optimization in PerformanceOptimizations component

#### Font Loading Optimization

- ✅ Added font-display: swap in CSS
- ✅ Added visibility control to prevent FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text)
- ✅ Added fonts.ready detection for stable layout

### 5. Video Loading Optimization

- ✅ Changed video preload from "metadata" to "none" for faster initial load
- ✅ Removed invalid loading attribute from video element

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Core Web Vitals

- **LCP**: Reduced by 20-30% through image priority and preloading
- **FCP**: Improved through better font loading and modern JavaScript
- **CLS**: Reduced through font loading optimizations and layout stability

### Bundle Size

- **JavaScript**: Estimated 13KB+ reduction through modern targeting
- **Images**: Better compression and lazy loading for non-critical images

### Loading Experience

- **Critical Path**: Optimized with preloads and priority hints
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Non-critical assets load after viewport
- **Modern Browsers**: Smaller bundles with native ES6+ features

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

1. **Image Format Optimization**: Consider using AVIF format for even better compression
2. **Code Splitting**: Implement dynamic imports for large components
3. **Service Worker**: Add caching strategy for static assets
4. **Resource Hints**: Add more specific preload hints for critical resources
5. **Critical CSS**: Extract above-the-fold CSS for faster rendering

## Monitoring
